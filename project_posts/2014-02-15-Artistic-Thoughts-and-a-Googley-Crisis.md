So, the test was yesterday (actually, the day before that because it is now like 2:38) and it was quite good, thanks for asking.

Some things arrive with this post in one awesome update.
So, I did some thinking about 3D modeling in java and tried some stuff. Also, finally got the technologies section to do what it should do.
This update brings some code from both the 3D modeling and the sending-javascript-queries-in-order-to-determine-one's-location section (found under utils).
My idea is that the model will change according to the country you are running this applet from, which can be really cool, IMO.

I figured out I'll try and write some of my artistic thoughts about the project:
I feel like music is becoming a part of my life which goes with me everywhere: on the bus, in the shower, while coding... But the more music I have in my life, the less I think of it as a special, immersing experience and more of a distraction.
I feel like just listening to music has become quite hard for me - I can't be fully concentrated on it without any visual data.
So, creating this visual data seemed like a reasonable choice for a project. I chose winter as a theme for this visualization because winter intuitively connects in my mind to life and to music, because there is so much motion and action in a winter scenery.
I will try and make it, as I think of it, a natural way to continue musical data into a 3d scene - something like analytic continuation for music. A visual data to company the music and align with it perfectly, creating a more fulfilling experience while keeping the music in the center of the creation.

In another subject, I still have a bit of a crisis as I really have no idea about how to use a google tool. I do use the Geocoding API but I feel like that's not enough.
The compute engine and predict API cost money (for cloud storage at least) and I am not really good about having money, and I'll try to eventually create a google engine app, but I am not sure about how that will work because I think GAE doesn't support j3d.
Also, I found many nice backgrounds to upload and thay will arrive soon to GitHub if all goes well.
