Some new things from today:
I figured out I'll give the maps API more place and really try to imitate the natural geography of the user's area.
I think it may create a cool result, a landscape that looks almost familiar yet machine-created.
Added backgrounds and started working on tree modeling today. A first draft of a tree will probably be up until next week.
