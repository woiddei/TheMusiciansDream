So today I first heard about the DevArt-Google act competition via an email from my university. After some thought I have decided to focus on imaging musical data as 3d scenes.
I looked around a little for a good 3d-modeling feature for java and I didn't really find anything yet. Modelling the terrain is relatively easy. The harder parts are modeling trees and the reflection on the water. I will try and work something out, but I may have to program the whole thing myself.
I tried to draw a first draft of a scene using inscape. This is how I see a model of a classical piece - actually, what I had in mind when I drew this was Tchaikovsky's "1812 overture".
