OMG LOOK AT THOSE BRANCHES!

![such fancy](../project_images/branch1.jpg?raw=true "such brown   so tree   much branch")

So yeah, it might look to many of you like a very first result but branches are now correctly modled.
I am very very exited about this, as you may already sense, because this is a first nontrivial result of my project.
I hode to model some full-scale trees by the end of the weak, and then I just have to figure out the wind animation.
All code is uploaded to gitHub now, including partial documentation.
Don't worry - all will be documented sooner or later.
Promise.
