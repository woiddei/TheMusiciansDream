I'm really, really tired tight now and I have tons of homework, so I'll keep this short.
The third demo is uploaded to my youtube acount and will soon be linked to from the project_summary page, which by the way started working again, thanks to the help I've got from their technical support.
I just uploaded a large code update to support the addition of wind, as you can see if you'll run app.Main.
I'm still trying to figure out how to export my applet to browsers, with little success so far.
That's it for today. Good night!

Someone actually commented on my demo! Thank you so much, it's nice to see someone actually reads this.
