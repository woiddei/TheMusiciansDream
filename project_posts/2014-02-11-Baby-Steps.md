Well, I have a huge test on friday (yes, that **is** valentine's day, it's so nice you remembered!), so I probably won't be able to update a lot until than. Sorry about that, if anyone actually reads this.
Meanwhile, in order to ~procrastinate~ relax a little while preparing, I played around a little with Java 3d, a nice high-level Java package build on top of other packages like DirectX and OpenGL. Also, updated my graphic driver to support OpenGL.
I created a basic applet, and right now it shows a ball. A green ball. Seems like things are going smoothly.
Also, I've done some research about tree modeling and found [this awesome article](https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall02/cps124/resources/p119-weber.pdf) which has pretty much everything. So yeah, that's nice.
I am still thinking how the MIDI file should affect the environment. Hope I'll figure it out soon.
I found some pictures for inspiration and textures (new cover photo! yay), and some sounds of rain. You can find them at project_sounds and project_textures.

Woohoo! New fancy cover:
![Woohoo! New fancy cover!](../project_images/cover1.jpg?raw=true "Woohoo! New fancy cover!")

Also, textures:
![textures](../project_textures/project_textures.jpg?raw=true "textures are cool")

*Also, if I haven't mentioned it yet, I know my English is a mess and I'm sorry for both me and you.*
