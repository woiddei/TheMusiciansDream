That's right - the trees now have wind enabled. I'll upload the code soon and add a demo to project_summary on the main page.
This page still won't update on devart.withgoogle, BTW. I have contacted them to see if they can figure out the problem.
Meanwhile, here are the first two demos for those of you who are to lazy to view my project at github:

I am very happy with the wind effect. As you can see, the second demo is much better looking than the first - hopefully this will also be the case with the third!
Well, I pulled yet another all-nighter to make this update, which required a lot of thinking and coding, and I have school tommorow - so I'll say good night to you all and go to bed.
