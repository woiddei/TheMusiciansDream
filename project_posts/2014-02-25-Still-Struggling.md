So, this may be a little depressing.
I didn't manage to solve the GC problem. Appearantly it is caused by the normal generating code of j3d, which I have to call if I want my tree to have color. So I'm stuck there.
I've tried to export the applet into a browser-enabled applet but I can't use the j3d package inside it for some reason, so that is one more failure.
I still have little idea how to go about the whole animation thing without creating even more huge ammounts of garbage and having to calculate the actual position of the tree before locating each branch for all branches to move in the same direction.
So yeah. Everything sucks. Hurray.
